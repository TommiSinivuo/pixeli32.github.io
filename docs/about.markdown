I'm Tommi Sinivuo, a self-taught professional programmer and wannabe hobbyist
game developer. I'm currently working on a puzzle game inspired by the
mechanics of Boulder Dash and the likes. My content will probably be related
to that and the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org) - a new low
level programming language, which I'm using to develop the game.

You can find me online on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TommiSinivuo) and
[Github](https://github.com/TommiSinivuo).
