I'm Tommi Sinivuo, a self-taught professional programmer and wannabe hobbyist
game developer. This is my blog, where I intend to write about programming,
especially game programming. I'm currently working on a puzzle game inspired by
the mechanics of Boulder Dash and the likes, so my content will probably be
highly related to that and the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org) -
a new low level programming language, which I'm using to develop the game.

You can find me online on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pixeli32) and
[Github](https://github.com/TommiSinivuo).
